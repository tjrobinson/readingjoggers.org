                  Club members meet at
                  <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Beansheaf+Community+Centre/@51.438765,-1.050468,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x4876995b2055a6c3:0x5e5d81beae0b0b3b"
                    target="_blank">Beansheaf Community Center, Reading, RG31 7AW</a> on Tuesday and Thursday evening at 7:00 pm for 7:20 start.
                  <br>
                  <br> Our regular Club runs last about 45 - 60 minutes and cover from 4 to 7 miles. There are several running
                  groups to choose from and each group runs at a different pace, from ~11:30 min/mile for the slowest to
                  about ~8 min/mile for the fastest. We can also arrange for an additional slower group if required so there
                  is ample choice for runners and joggers of all abilities. We use a dozen or more well-tried routes around
                  Calcot and Tilehurst, often on woodland trails, canal and lakes during the lighter summer evenings, but
                  choose the local well-lit pavements during the winter. Throughout the year, we offer pleasant running to
                  anyone who prefers not to train alone. Each group has a leader appointed by the Club Captain, or his deputy,
                  to show the way around the route. The group leader will also try to find an experienced runner to stay
                  with anyone lagging behind, and deal with any minor incidents that may happen, but it must be stressed
                  that runners take part at their own risk.
                  <br>
                  <br> Exception:
                  <br> On Thursdays the club runs training programs and this can take place at a different venue, details listed
                  below.

                  <br> Session will start at 19:20
                  <br>
                  <br> This can be either a speed and acceleration drill or a strength-endurance session. This is dependent of the length of
                  the zigzags. This session will be for strength-endurance. A series of six markers are placed at approximately 60m intervals.
                  Six 60m sprints are made with approximately 90 degree turns around each marker. Because you have to decelerate to get round
                  each marker and then accelerate to the next marker, this will improve both your co-ordination, strength and ability to
                  accelerate. As a bonus this will help you in a race situation. You will then jog or walk back (the long three sided way)
                  back to the start. Each set will consist of 4 or 5 runs and then a complete recovery of 4-5 minutes before the next set.
                  There will be 2 or 3 sets. The long recovery will ensure maximum intensity for each set.
                  <br> The time for this session will be 35-40 minutes.
                  <br> This session will be on grass.

                  <h3>Thursday 31st May 2018 : Kenyan Hills</h3>
                  Meet at
                  <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Prospect+Park/@51.4482918,-1.0131572,16z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x48769bbdeb5b73e5:0xdd1dd918a5735bc">Prospect Park, Main car park, RG30 2ND.</a>
                  <br> Meet at 19:00 for 19:20 start
                  <br>
                  <br> It is dependant on the state of the ground if we are going to do Kenyan Hills tonight. If the area is unsuitable we will
                  still do a session in Prospect Park.
                  <br> Many runners have a love-hate relationship with hills, often because they approach them incorrectly. They try to charge
                  up them as if they don’t exist in order to get them over with as soon as possible. Hills should be a test of patience and
                  pacing to enable you to carry on at a comfortable pace and not to be gasping for air and slow up at the top. After all
                  if you are going to be racing on hills (and there are not many races without a hill or two) then you should be training
                  on them – not all the time, but frequently enough so that when you meet one in a race then you will know how to approach
                  it.
                  <br> Hill running is great for improving your running efficiency, because it can give you the strength training that you can
                  get from short intervals, but it can also improve your running form. It forces you, or at least it should do, to get you
                  on to the ball of your foot for the next push off. And don’t forget to use your arms to help you get up the hill, but stay
                  relaxed.
                  <br>
                  <br> What do Kenyans Hills give you.....In short.... A better aerobic endurance, improved strength endurance, increased running
                  economy, improved stride length and cadence.
                  <br> This ideal pace is for you to be working at 80-85% of MHR (Maximum Heart Rate), or in plain English you should be able
                  to utter 4-5 words at the top (if you're lucky).
                  <br> The entire session will last 30-35 minutes plus the warm up, cool down and stretching.
