This session based on Lansdowne Road and Grafton Road, which lies between Mayfair and Halls Road.

The first 900m is at just under 10K pace and the final 100m at a faster pace. Each 1000m will be followed by a 3 minute recovery. The faster 100m is NOT an all out sprint, more like just under 5K pace.

The session will last 35-40 Minutes.

During your recovery period, keep moving, walk or a very gentle jog and please do not stay on the path, to allow others to pass freely.
