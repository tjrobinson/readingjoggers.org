This session will be held on <a routerLink="/find-us/other-locations">The Chase</a> (about 800m from Beansheaf - you can partly warm up getting there).
   
It is run between Grangely Close and Kettering Close.
     
800m intervals with a 60 second recovery after each 800m
     
Repeat above until time set of 35-40 minutes is finished.
    
Based on 10K race speed (which means you will be going a little faster than your 10K pace. See example below). It would help if you can remember your latest 10K time.
   
Example: If your 10K race speed is 50:00 then your 400/800m time is 2:00/4:00. Your target would be 1:55/3:50. This involves a gentle uphill and downhill.
