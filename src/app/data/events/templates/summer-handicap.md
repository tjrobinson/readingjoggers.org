For those new to the summer handicap, the course is clearly marked and if you turn up early enough there will also be a map for you to look at.

Meet at the main car park in Prospect Park at 7:00pm for the first runner to be away by 19:20pm.

After the Handicap many will go up to the Mansion House to replace lost liquid and a chat.
