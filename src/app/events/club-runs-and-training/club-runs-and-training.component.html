      target="_blank">Beansheaf Community Center, Reading, RG31 7AW</a> or (usually on the last Tuesday of the month)
    from
    <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Prospect+Park/@51.4482918,-1.0131572,16z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x48769bbdeb5b73e5:0xdd1dd918a5735bc">Prospect
      Park, Main Car Park, RG30 2ND</a>. Please see below for details.
    <br>
    <br>On Thursdays, in addition to a regular club run, we hold training sessions and our Summer Handicap series. The
    location
    and content of these sessions vary, so please see below for details.
    <br>
    <br>For all evening sessions, including training and the Summer Handicap, we meet at 7:00pm for a 7:20pm start.
    <br>
    <br> Our regular club runs last about 45 - 60 minutes and cover from 4 to 7 miles. There are several running groups
    to
    choose from and each group runs at a different pace, from ~11:30 min/mile for the slowest to about ~8 min/mile for
    the
    fastest. We can also arrange for an additional slower group if required so there is ample choice for runners and
    joggers
    of all abilities. We use a dozen or more well-tried routes around Calcot and Tilehurst, often on woodland trails,
    canal
    and lakes during the lighter summer evenings, but choose the local well-lit pavements during the winter. Throughout
    the
    year, we offer pleasant running to anyone who prefers not to train alone. Each group has a leader appointed by the
    Club
    Captain, or his deputy, to show the way around the route. The group leader will also try to find an experienced
    runner
    to stay with anyone lagging behind, and deal with any minor incidents that may happen, but it must be stressed that
    runners
    take part at their own risk.

    <br>
    <br>OR
    <br>
    <br>800m intervals with a minutes recovery after each 800m
    <br>
    <br>Repeat above until time set of 35-40 minutes is finished.
    <br>
    <br>Based on 10K race speed (which means you will be going a little faster than your 10K pace. See example below).
    It would help if you can remember your latest 10K time.

    <br>The first 400m is at just under 10K pace and the final 100m at a faster pace. Each 500m will be followed by a 2
    minute recovery. The faster 100m is NOT an all out sprint, but more like your finishing burst at the end of a race.

    <br>The session will last 35-40 Minutes.
    <br>
    <br>During your recovery period, keep moving, walk or a very gentle jog and please do not stay on the path, to
    allow others to pass freely.
