<h2>Club Runs & Training</h2>
<p>Our regular club runs are held every week on Tuesday and Thursday and start at either the <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Beansheaf+Community+Centre/@51.438765,-1.050468,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x4876995b2055a6c3:0x5e5d81beae0b0b3b"
        target="_blank">Beansheaf Community Center, Reading, RG31 7AW</a> or (usually on the last Tuesday of the month)
    from <a href="https://www.google.co.uk/maps/place/Prospect+Park/@51.4482918,-1.0131572,16z/data=!4m2!3m1!1s0x48769bbdeb5b73e5:0xdd1dd918a5735bc">Prospect
        Park, Main Car Park, RG30 2ND</a>. Please see below for details.</p>
<p>On <strong>Thursdays</strong>, in addition to a regular club run, we hold training sessions and our <a routerLink="/events/summer-handicap">Summer
        Handicap</a> series. The location and content of these sessions vary, so please see below for details.</p>
<p>For all evening sessions, including training and the Summer Handicap, we meet at 7:00pm for a 7:20pm start.</p>
<p>Our regular club runs last about 45 - 60 minutes and cover from 4 to 7 miles. There are several running groups to
    choose from and each group runs at a different pace, from ~11:30 min/mile for the slowest to about ~8 min/mile for
    the fastest. We can also arrange for an additional slower group if required so there is ample choice for runners
    and joggers of all abilities. We use a dozen or more well-tried routes around Calcot and Tilehurst, often on
    woodland trails, canal and lakes during the lighter summer evenings, but choose the local well-lit pavements during
    the winter. Throughout the year, we offer pleasant running to anyone who prefers not to train alone. Each group has
    a leader appointed by the Club Captain, or his deputy, to show the way around the route. The group leader will also
    try to find an experienced runner to stay with anyone lagging behind, and deal with any minor incidents that may
    happen, but it must be stressed that runners take part at their own risk.</p>
